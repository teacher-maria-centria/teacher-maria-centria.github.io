# Stuff I like 

On this website I will tell you about stuff I like 

### Knitting

Loop by loop, I stitch serenity into sweaters and sass into scarves.

### Kettlebelss 

Swinging iron to stay strong — because lifting spirits is easier when you lift weights first.

### Vegan cooking 

Turning plants into poetry — one sizzling skillet at a time.

### My kids 

My favorite debugging team: always curious, occasionally chaotic, endlessly inspiring.

### Forests 

Where Wi-Fi is weak but the connection is strong — nature’s original network.

### Picking berries and Mushrooms

Foraging: the art of treasure hunting with snacks as the prize. 

### Freewater Swimming 

No lanes, no limits — just me, the see, and a splash of freedom.

### Indie Gigs 

Loud, local, and slightly offbeat — just like my playlist and personality.

### Programming 

I speak fluent Java, Python and sarcasm — both compile nicely.

### Nerdy Stuff 

If it’s obscure, overengineered, or oddly fascinating, I’m probably into it.

### Work 

Where I turn caffeine into code and meetings into memes.
